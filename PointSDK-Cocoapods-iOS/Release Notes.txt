Bluedot Point SDK iOS v1.8.1 Release Notes
----------------------------------------
New feature: 
The iOS SDK can deliver to the app the current location service authorization status as a parameter in the user interval call back methods.
- (void)didStartRequiringUserInterventionForLocationServicesAuthorizationStatus:authorizationStatus
- (void)didStopRequiringUserInterventionForLocationServicesAuthorizationStatus:authorizationStatus
Enhancements:
Zones that are disabled at device level stay disabled across user sessions.
The lack of data connection can cause the Check-Ins to be queued within the SDK. The SDK is able to persist the failed Check-In records and batch process at a later point when the data connectivity is re-established.
Fully compatible with iOS 10
